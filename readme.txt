Easily add a customizable age verification screen to your store.

== Description ==
Age Verification Screen for WooCommerce lets you restrict your website or particular pages of it using the age-restriction screen. Easily install and configure pop-up look and texts via customizer tool.

= Major plugin features =

* **Modal window or full-page pop-up to ask your users to verify their age when the page loads.**
* **Show the age restriction pop-up only on those pages where you need it.** You can choose what pages, products, categories, or any other post types or taxonomies would be age-restricted.
* **Select the minimum allowed age for your website.**
* **Multiple ways to check user age.** You can choose between two methods of age verification - a simple checkbox or confirm\cancel buttons.
* **Set up the look and feel of restriction pop-up via live customizer.** Select background color or image, blur opacity, text color, etc.
* **All texts are editable through the customizer.** You are able to edit the heading, description, texts on buttons, etc.
* **Redirect users on failure.** Here you can find two default options - get the user to the previous page or any other page of your site (e.g., page w/ your age policy).
* **Accepts your theme styling by default.** No need to work hard on pop-up styling; it fits your website style perfectly right off the bat.
* **Manage cookie lifetime.** Age verification pop-up should not appear once more for those who previously passed the confirmation within XX days (established by you).

= Additional features =

* An additional method to check the age. One more way to prevent users' age is the date of birth picker.
* Redirect to external URL. If the user doesn't reach the minimum required age, you can redirect him to the external website instead of your internal page.
* Age-restriction for custom taxonomies and custom post types. In case you need to restrict particular custom taxonomies or post types instead of regular ones (like product categories, products, pages, etc).
* Assistance from plugin developers first hand.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can plugin somehow hurt my SEO?  =
Nope. Age verification pop-up doesn't interfere with crawlers to index your website.

= Can I restrict one specific page, not a whole site?  =
Sure you can. Simply choose what type of content you wish to restrict, then go to this page/post/taxonomy/etc and tick the age-restriction checkbox in settings.

= How do the cookies work?  =
If the user already passed the age-check, we save cookie files in their browser, so if they come back again, they passed verification automatically.
